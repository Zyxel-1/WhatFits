                       When I discovered that WhatFits allows locals to see how much I can lift, I became invigorated.
                       Now instead of going to the gym twice per day, I go at least four time per day to log my workouts.
                       Sometimes I even chat up local users to see if they want to workout. WhatFits has definitely been
                       a game changer!"</p>
